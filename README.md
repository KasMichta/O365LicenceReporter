# O365 Licence Reporter

Intended use:

Run a PowerShell script to generate Office 365 Licence Reports that create HTML formatted tables.

Then use a Python utility to convert the HTML formatted tables into PDFs that can be viewed by users.

The PDFs should then be exported and saved within an organised folder structure.
